## Hanap: UPLB Class Venue Finder Mobile Application
### Author: Von Michael Arellano and Mylah Rystie Anacleto

### Abstract
This study addresses the persistent challenges faced by University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB) constituents in navigating campus spaces, particularly in locating class venues. Despite existing resources, students encounter difficulties leading to stress and tardiness. To alleviate this, the study proposes the development of a dedicated application designed for UPLB, aiming to enhance wayfinding efficiency. The application, utilizing React-Native and Vue.js with Firebase backend, incorporates administrative controls for map updates and user-friendly features for university constituents. Testing involves simulation by admin and non-admin users, and evaluation of performance, functionality, and usability. By creating a reliable wayfinding tool, the study contributes to a more positive academic environment, reducing stress and enhancing navigation for UPLB constituents.
