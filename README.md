Authors: Von Michael B. Arellano and Mylah Rystie U. Anacleto

This study addresses the persistent challenges faced by University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB) constituents in navigating campus spaces, particularly in locating class venues. The Hanap application is a mobile application designed to help students alleviate these wayfinding challenges. This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate the application in terms of its usability and capability to aid users in campus navigation to a chosen destination. Testing involved simulations by admin and non-admin users, with results showing a mean System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 85.58, indicating excellent usability. This study contributes to a more positive academic environment by reducing stress and enhancing navigation for UPLB constituents.
